# Requirements Specification: Korean File Name Normalizer

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
This document specifies the functional and non-functional requirements for the Korean File Name Normalizer web application. The system will convert Korean file names from NFD (Normalized Form Decomposed) to NFC (Normalized Form Composed) encoding format.

### 1.2 Scope
The application will provide a web-based interface for users to upload files with NFD-encoded Korean names and download them with NFC-encoded names, resolving compatibility issues between different operating systems.

### 1.3 Definitions
- **NFD**: Normalized Form Decomposed - Unicode normalization where characters are decomposed
- **NFC**: Normalized Form Composed - Unicode normalization where characters are precomposed
- **Client-side**: Processing that occurs in the user's web browser
- **Batch processing**: Handling multiple files in a single operation
