# Project Proposal: Korean File Name Normalizer

## Executive Summary

This proposal outlines the development of a web-based tool that addresses the widespread issue of broken Korean file names caused by Unicode normalization differences between operating systems. The tool will convert file names from NFD (Normalized Form Decomposed) to NFC (Normalized Form Composed) encoding, ensuring compatibility across different platforms.

## Project Objectives

### Primary Objectives
1. **Develop a user-friendly web application** that normalizes Korean file names from NFD to NFC format
2. **Ensure privacy and security** by processing all files client-side without server uploads
3. **Support batch processing** to handle multiple files efficiently
4. **Provide bilingual interface** in Korean and English for accessibility

### Secondary Objectives
1. Create a tool that requires no installation or technical expertise
2. Maintain file integrity during the normalization process
3. Build a responsive design that works across all modern browsers
4. Establish a foundation for future Unicode-related tools

## Project Scope

### In Scope
- Single-page web application for file name normalization
- Drag-and-drop file upload interface
- NFD to NFC conversion for Korean characters
- Batch file processing capabilities
- Individual and bulk download options
- Bilingual user interface (Korean/English)
- Client-side only processing for privacy
- Support for all common file types and extensions

### Out of Scope
- Server-side processing or file storage
- File content modification (only file names are changed)
- Folder structure processing (initial version)
- Mobile native applications
- Conversion of non-Korean Unicode characters
- NFC to NFD reverse conversion (initial version)

## Benefits

### For End Users
1. **Immediate Problem Resolution**: Fixes broken Korean file names instantly
2. **Zero Cost**: Free to use with no subscription or payment required
3. **Privacy Protection**: Files never leave the user's computer
4. **No Installation**: Works directly in web browser
5. **Cross-Platform**: Solves compatibility issues between macOS and Windows/Linux

### For Organizations
1. **Productivity Improvement**: Reduces time spent on file name issues
2. **Data Integrity**: Prevents file loss due to encoding problems
3. **Compliance**: Helps maintain proper file naming in multilingual environments
4. **Cost Savings**: Eliminates need for commercial solutions

### Technical Benefits
1. **Scalability**: Client-side processing means no server infrastructure needed
2. **Maintenance**: Minimal ongoing maintenance requirements
3. **Security**: No data transmission reduces security risks
4. **Performance**: Local processing provides instant results
